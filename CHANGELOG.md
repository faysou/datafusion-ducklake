## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add read-only DuckLake views across metadata backends and writer-compatible view metadata (#264).
- Scoped DuckLake writer settings now control compression, row groups, file
  rollover, sorting, partition paths, and the inclusive
  `data_inlining_row_limit`. Small writes can stay in the metadata catalog with
  stable row IDs, snapshot visibility, table statistics, mixed positional and
  inline deletes, and DuckDB extension interoperability.
- Metadata access APIs for embedding catalogs: `MetadataProvider::list_snapshot_changes`
  exposes the snapshot change ledger (`ducklake_snapshot_changes`) column-for-column,
  `MetadataProvider::find_snapshot_by_commit_extra_info` finds the first live-data snapshot
  whose opaque `commit_extra_info` equals or contains a caller-supplied needle,
  `MetadataWriter::set_table_setting` upserts a table-scoped `ducklake_metadata` setting, and
  `MetadataWriter::with_commit_lock` runs an operation under a backend-appropriate commit
  coordination lock (PostgreSQL advisory transaction lock, SQLite file lock) with the lock
  released on success and error and the operation's error taking precedence. Implemented for
  SQLite and PostgreSQL with shared contract tests; other backends keep `Unsupported`
  defaults (#274).
- SQL `DELETE` predicates spanning Parquet-resident and catalog-inlined rows
  commit both forms in one snapshot on all four write backends: DuckDB and
  MySQL implement `commit_deletes`, and truncate ends visible inline rows and
  returns the exact live row count, inline rows included (#273).
- `DuckLakeWriteTransaction` stages Parquet files, inlined rows, and deletes for
  several tables, then commits them in one DuckDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL
  metadata transaction and one snapshot. A shared write precondition rejects
  the complete commit before mutation, and a failed commit removes every
  staged Parquet data or delete object.

### Changed

- A failed `DuckLakeWriteTransaction` commit removes its staged Parquet data
  and delete objects only on a definite pre-commit rejection (conflict,
  validation, or unsupported-operation error). An ambiguous failure, such as a
  lost COMMIT acknowledgement on a network backend, leaves the objects to the
  guarded vacuum so a commit that actually landed never references deleted
  files (#274).

- Small writes at or below `data_inlining_row_limit` inline only when the
  writer's schema-aware `supports_data_inlining` probe accepts the schema;
  otherwise they fall back to Parquet instead of failing. The standard
  single-catalog PostgreSQL writer and external `MetadataWriter`
  implementations keep working for small writes, and column types a backend
  cannot round-trip through its inline encodings stay on Parquet (#272).
- SQL `UPDATE` and row-lineage (`rowid`) scans on a table with visible inlined
  rows refuse with a clear error instead of silently updating zero rows or
  returning empty lineage; flush the rows to Parquet or disable inlining at
  write time to use them (#272).

### Fixed

- The MySQL multi-table commit allocates its snapshot — taking the serializing
  counter lock — before any fence or liveness read, so a concurrent committer
  can no longer pass the fence on a stale InnoDB read view or allocate an
  overlapping `row_id` range (#274).
- A multi-table commit that creates several tables in a fresh schema records
  the schema's `created_schema:` ledger entry exactly once (#274).
- MySQL allocates every `data_file_id` and `delete_file_id` from the catalog
  counters instead of mixing auto-increment appends with counter-seeded
  explicit ids, removing certain primary-key collisions between the append and
  update/delete/compaction paths (#273).
- Every DuckDB and MySQL mutation flow — `set_delete_file`, positional
  deletes, retire, truncate, and promote — records its
  `ducklake_snapshot_changes.changes_made` entry, so data-modifying snapshots
  are no longer hidden from spec readers (#273).
- The first write to a table that was staged but never written commits and
  seeds its stats row instead of failing permanently with a retry-suggesting
  `Conflict` (#273).
- SQLite and MySQL inline value encodings round-trip exactly: floats are
  stored as `DOUBLE` and binary columns, including `blob`/`BinaryView`, as
  `BLOB`. Bytes previously read back as the hex string of themselves, and
  SQLite committed timestamp and float encodings its own inline reader could
  not decode (#272).
- Inline commits honor `expected_base_snapshot_id`, `commit_metadata`, and the
  partition-spec conflict check, including the inline branch of partitioned
  small writes, so optimistic concurrency is no longer silently disabled for
  small writes (#272).
- `register_inlined_data` appends to the snapshot's `changes_made` ledger
  instead of overwriting `created_schema:`/`created_table:` entries, and a
  Replace that ended prior data — Parquet or inlined — records delete plus
  insert on every commit path (#272).
- MySQL inline-table DDL runs before the write transaction opens, so MySQL's
  implicit DDL commit can no longer split an inline write into several
  effective commits or leave a partially committed snapshot after a mid-write
  failure (#272).
- `files_matching` prunes a data file that carries a delete file. Its recorded
  bounds are marked inexact for readers that apply deletes, and the pruning view
  uses only exact ones, so the first mutation to write a delete file stopped that
  file contributing usable bounds to every later call — permanently, since
  compaction skips delete-bearing files. Callers of `files_matching` read physical
  rows without applying deletes, where the spec's lower/upper bounds still hold,
  so they are restated as usable on that path alone; scan statistics are
  unchanged. The live row count is withheld rather than restated, being the one
  figure deletes change, and promoting it alongside a physical null count would
  let a file be judged entirely null and dropped while still holding matching
  rows (#276).

- `merge_adjacent_files` no longer selects a data file whose rows are masked
  only by inlined deletes, so a merge cannot erase those rows from historical
  snapshots or leave `ducklake_inlined_delete_<table_id>` entries pointing at
  a removed file; time travel across the merge is preserved (#262).
- SQL `DELETE` counts positions already removed by inlined deletes as deleted,
  so a predicate matching only inline-deleted rows is a no-op that commits no
  snapshot and no delete file, and reported delete counts are exact (#262).
- Compaction commits fence on each source file's inlined-delete row count and
  abort with `Conflict` when a concurrent inlined `DELETE` lands between
  planning and commit, instead of resurrecting the deleted row at the new head
  (#262).
- Table scans and `COUNT(*)` include scalar rows inlined in SQLite, DuckDB,
  PostgreSQL, and MySQL metadata catalogs. DuckLake inlines inserts of up to 10
  rows by default, so affected queries previously omitted them without warning;
  unsupported non‑scalar inline values now report how to flush or disable
  inlining (#261).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- Sort order: `ALTER TABLE … SET`/`RESET SORTED BY (col [ASC|DESC] [NULLS FIRST|LAST])`, recorded in `ducklake_sort_info`/`ducklake_sort_expression` and applied to insert, `UPDATE` rewrites, and compaction output so per-file statistics tighten (#206, #211).
- `PostgresSingleCatalogMetadataWriter` — writes the **standard, spec-compliant** single-catalog DuckLake layout on PostgreSQL (no `catalog_id` columns, no `ducklake_catalog*` map tables, unscoped relative paths), so Postgres catalogs are interchangeable with the SQLite/MySQL backends and DuckDB's `ducklake` extension. SQL `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` works on this path, unlike the multicatalog writer (#231).
- Snapshot time travel: `DuckLakeCatalog::with_snapshot_at` and `ducklake_table_at()` select a snapshot by id or timestamp (#236).
- Recursive `list`, `struct`, and `map` columns use standard `ducklake_column` parent links and matching Parquet field IDs across reads, writes, schema evolution, rewrites, and compaction (#230).
- Partitioned writes on **every** writable backend: compaction, the low-level `write_rows`/`write_table`/`append_table` entry points, and `register_existing_data_file` (promote) all honour the table's live spec, and every commit path is fenced against it (#213).
- Atomic append+delete commits accept SEVERAL appended data files: `MetadataWriter::register_data_files_with_deletes` (and its conditional `_and_commit_metadata` sibling) register N data files plus M positional delete files in ONE snapshot, matching the reference implementation. A keyed mutation therefore works on a partitioned table and on a write that rolled past `target_file_size` (#214, #223).
- SQL `UPDATE` on a PARTITIONED table: each rewritten row is routed by its own post-assignment key values, so an assignment that changes a partition key moves the row to its new partition (calendar transforms included). A rewrite spanning several partitions writes one file per partition and commits them all — with the positional deletes — in one snapshot, preserving every row's `rowid` lineage (#239).
- Snapshot metadata and write preconditions: one DuckLake change row per committed snapshot, optional author/message/opaque extra info, and conditional writes fenced against table generation changes, on SQLite and PostgreSQL (#209).
- A streaming write rolls a new data file once the current one passes `target_file_size` (512 MiB default, floored at 4096 bytes) and commits them all in one snapshot, matching official DuckLake; `begin_write_single_file` opts out for sessions finished with `finish_with_deletes` (#224).
- Targeted rewrites: `rewrite_data_files` accepts caller-selected live files without a delete threshold, and streams sort output through DataFusion's spill-capable operator (#211).
- `DuckLakeTable::files_matching` — the data files a predicate could match, pruned by exactly the catalog statistics and partition bounds a `SELECT` with the same filter uses, so a caller driving its own per-file work no longer has to open every data file to find the ones holding a key. Pruning is fail-open and files are read in bounded pages (#240).
- `DuckLakeTable::file_has_embedded_rowid` is now public, and available without the write features. It reports where a row's `rowid` comes from — the file's embedded row-id column when it has one, `row_id_start + physical position` otherwise (#258).
- `column_size_bytes` is populated per column on write (summed from the parquet footer, no extra I/O), and `compute_column_stats` is exposed for callers that already hold a parsed footer (#201).
- Tracing spans over the write path — `ducklake.begin_write_transaction`, `ducklake.register_data_files`, `ducklake.finalize_snapshot`, `ducklake.write_session_finish`, `ducklake.upload_staged_file` (#252).

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `ducklake_table_changes`, `ducklake_table_insertions` and `ducklake_table_deletions` resolve each data file's columns **by field id**, as of the window's end snapshot, instead of by current name — matching official DuckLake. Output changes, silently, on any table whose columns were renamed or dropped and re-added: a renamed column returned NULL for rows in files written before the rename and now returns those rows' values; a column dropped and re-added under the same name returned the DROPPED column's values and now returns NULL there; two columns whose names were swapped returned each other's values and now return their own; a field renamed inside a `STRUCT` behaves the same way as a top-level one.

  The fix is **not retroactive**: nothing in the catalog was damaged, so no repair tooling is needed — but anything derived from earlier feed output on an affected table is still wrong. **Re-derive anything built from change-feed output on a table whose columns were renamed, or dropped and re-added.** To find those tables:

  ```sql
  SELECT table_id, column_id, count(*) AS generations
  FROM ducklake_column GROUP BY table_id, column_id HAVING count(*) > 1;

  SELECT table_id, column_name, count(DISTINCT column_id) AS ids
  FROM ducklake_column GROUP BY table_id, column_name HAVING count(DISTINCT column_id) > 1;
  ```

  Field ids come from each file's parquet footer, so the feeds now read one footer per data file — the insert-only feed previously read none. On a table with **encrypted** files the footers cannot be read, so a feed whose window spans a rename or a drop-and-re-add is refused with an error rather than served by name; see COMPATIBILITY.md (#253).
- **BREAKING**: PostgreSQL metadata features no longer select a TLS provider. Consumers that need TLS must also enable one of `tls-native-tls`, `tls-rustls-aws-lc-rs`, or `tls-rustls-ring`. Without one, SQLx rejects connections that require TLS and may try plaintext when `sslmode` prefers TLS. No catalog or data migration is needed (#247).
- **BREAKING**: S3 support is no longer selected by the library. Consumers using `object_store::aws` must enable `object_store/aws` in their application or register another `ObjectStore` implementation with DataFusion. Local filesystem support remains available through DataFusion without extra configuration. No catalog or data migration is needed (#247).
- **BREAKING**: DataFusion is depended on with `default-features = false` (only `parquet`, `recursive_protection`, and `sql`). Consumers relying on a DataFusion feature that used to arrive transitively must enable it themselves (#265).
- **BREAKING**: the minimum supported Rust version is now 1.94, the floor set by sqlx 0.9 (#205).
- `TableWriteSession::finish_with_deletes` no longer refuses a session that produced more than one appended file; it commits them all in the snapshot that carries the deletes (#214).
- `TableChangesTable`, `TableInsertionsTable` and `TableDeletionsTable` accept the table's columns through a new `with_columns` builder. No signature changed; without it the columns are read from the metadata provider on each scan (#253).
- The multicatalog Postgres writer sends per-column statistics as one `UNNEST` insert per table instead of a statement per column, removing a round trip per column from every commit (#252).

### Fixed
- `ducklake_table_deletions` silently missed deletions, or emitted the wrong row's content and rowid, whenever DataFusion parallelized its scans: `DeletedRowsExec` inherited the data scan's partitioning, so the optimizer inserted round-robin repartitions and the per-stream offset counted arrival order rather than physical position. It now reports single partitioning, keeps its internal scans away from the optimizer, and matches deleted rows by true physical position (#178, #200).
- Float pruning is NaN-aware. Catalog float min/max exclude NaN while NaN sorts above every value, so a file whose NaN state was unknown or positive could be wrongly pruned on `x > C` while holding matching rows. Stored float maxima are now gated on `contains_nan = false` at every consumption point, and NaN-unsafe predicates no longer reach the parquet reader's row-group and page pruning (#203).
- `decimal(P)` with `P > 38` maps to `Decimal256` instead of an invalid `Decimal128`, which could panic or truncate on decode; and a parquet file carrying two columns with the same `field_id` drops both from the field-id map — the reader null-fills instead of binding the wrong column on the renamed-column read path (#193, #198, #202).
- Timezone-aware timestamp writes now record UTC min/max statistics for file pruning; catalogs written before this change remain readable with absent bounds (#260).
- A keyed `DELETE` or `UPDATE` works on a data file that compaction has rewritten. The filtered delete path previously refused such a file outright — a v1 scope limit documented as though position resolution depended on `rowid = row_id_start + physical position`. It does not: `resolve_positions` reads a file's true physical row positions, and a delete file's `pos` is a physical index, which a rewrite leaves meaningful. A table can now be compacted and still take `DELETE`/`UPDATE`/upsert, which previously required choosing one or the other (#258).
- PostgreSQL `commit_compaction` persists partition metadata, so a merged or rewritten file of a partitioned table keeps its `partition_id` and `ducklake_file_partition_value` rows. Reads stayed correct because zone maps still prune, which is what made this quiet — partition-value pruning was permanently gone while queries still returned the right rows (#246).
- PostgreSQL `register_data_file_with_deletes` persists partition metadata, so the append+delete (update/upsert) path no longer leaves an appended file that can never be partition-pruned again (#225).
- Multicatalog data paths are scoped per catalog: each catalog's root is stored on the registry and resolved for writer, reader, and maintenance paths, with the global metadata path kept as a migration fallback (#266).
- Pruning survives missing statistics. An absent per-file bound is now a typed null, so one file without statistics no longer makes a column unusable for the whole candidate set; files with unknown bounds are kept and exactly-non-matching files are still dropped (#250).
- Conjunctive pruning predicates are applied repeatedly over bounded pages of file metadata, so partition pruning can expose usable range statistics without loading the full file list (#207).
- A data file the catalog records as holding exactly zero rows is dropped before statistics are consulted, saving a pruning pass and closing the residual case where such a file carries no per-column statistics row at all and defeats pruning on that column for the whole page. Only a recorded count of exactly 0 counts as proof; an unset `record_count` keeps the file (#244).
- `types::build_read_schema_with_field_id_mapping` declares the `PARQUET:field_id` of every nested node the data file tags — list elements, struct children, map key/value, at any depth. A nested node's field id is part of its parent's Arrow type, so a read schema that omitted it disagreed with the batches the parquet reader produces from the very file it describes ("column types must match schema types"). Scans through this crate's `TableProvider` were unaffected; callers pairing that schema with arrow-rs themselves hit the error directly (#249).
- A `SELECT` over a table whose struct child was added or renamed by DDL no longer fails with "Cannot cast nullable struct field … to non-nullable field". DuckLake records such a child as non-nullable while the physical parquet node stays optional; nested nullability is now relaxed exactly as the sibling `build_arrow_schema` does, and map keys stay non-nullable (#253).
- Reads null-fill fields added inside structs, including non-nullable fields and structs nested in lists, while preserving field-ID-based nested renames and drops; and a write upgrades legacy single-row `list<T>` metadata to recursive list and element rows without changing the existing list column ID or invalidating historical snapshots (#230).
- The CDC table functions resolve the TABLE and its schema at the window's end snapshot, not at the catalog's current snapshot. A window over a table that was dropped afterwards failed with "Table 'main.t' not found in catalog" even though every snapshot in the window still had the table; it now returns that window's changes. A window whose end snapshot is past the drop — or before the create — reports that the table does not exist at that snapshot, matching official DuckLake (#196, #253).
