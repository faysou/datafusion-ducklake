//! Maintenance operations for DuckLake catalogs: snapshot expiration, physical
//! file cleanup, and orphaned-file reclamation.
//!
//! These port the three official DuckLake maintenance commands:
//!
//! 1. **expire** ([`crate::metadata_writer_sqlite::SqliteMetadataWriter::expire_snapshots`],
//!    [`crate::multicatalog::MulticatalogManager::expire_snapshots_in_catalog`]) deletes the
//!    chosen snapshots, garbage-collects every table / data file / delete file that is no
//!    longer reachable by any surviving snapshot, and records the orphaned physical paths in
//!    `ducklake_files_scheduled_for_deletion`. No object storage is touched.
//! 2. **cleanup_old_files** ([`cleanup_old_files_sqlite`], [`cleanup_old_files_in_catalog`])
//!    reads the scheduled rows, deletes the objects from the object store, and removes the rows.
//! 3. **delete_orphaned_files** ([`delete_orphaned_files_sqlite`],
//!    [`delete_orphaned_files_in_catalog`], [`delete_orphaned_files_multicatalog`]) lists a data
//!    path, subtracts referenced data files, delete files, and files still scheduled for deletion,
//!    and deletes whatever is left. The catalog-scoped form catches files left by aborted writes.
//!    The global form also reclaims dropped-catalog files from retained data-path tombstones.
//!
//! The metadata writers deliberately hold no object store — physical I/O lives here so the
//! catalog layer stays storage-agnostic (the object store comes from the caller, e.g. the
//! same one a [`crate::table_writer::DuckLakeTableWriter`] was built with).
